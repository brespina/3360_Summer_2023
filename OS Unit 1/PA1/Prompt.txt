Problem:
For this assignment, you will create a multithreaded Run-length encoder (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-length_encoding).

Given an input string, you generate the Run-length code and frequencies by executing the following steps:

Determine the RLE string by representing run lengths (runs of a character in the input string) by adding this character twice to the RLE string (any time a character appears twice, it denotes a run).  
Determine the frequency of the run lengths in the RLE string.
For example, given the following string:

WWWWWWWWWWWWBWWWWWWWWWWWWBBBWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWBWWWWWWWWWWWWWW

The expected RLE string and frequency array are:

RLE String: WWBWWBBWWBWW
RLE Frequencies: 12 12 3 24 14

Process:

Your solution must execute the following steps:

Read from STDIN the n strings.
Create n POSIX threads (where n is the number of strings). Each child thread executes the following tasks:
          - Receives the string to compress from the main thread.

          - Applies the run-length encoding algorithm to determine the RLE string and the frequency array.

          - Stores the RLE string and the frequency array on a memory location accessible by the main thread.

Print the information about the RLE codes for all strings from the input.
Given the following input strings:

WWWWWWWWWWWWBWWWWWWWWWWWWBBBWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWBWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
00000000001000000000001110000000000000001100000000000000000001
100000000000000000000000000000001

RLE String: WWBWWBBWWBWW
RLE Frequencies: 12 12 3 24 14 

Input string: 00000000001000000000001110000000000000001100000000000000000001
RLE String: 00100110011001
RLE Frequencies: 10 11 3 15 2 19 

Input string: 100000000000000000000000000000001
RLE String: 1001
RLE Frequencies: 31 

Input string: 00000000000000010000000000000000100000000000001000000000000010000000000000
RLE String: 00100100100100
RLE Frequencies: 15 16 13 13 13
NOTES:

You can safely assume that the input will always be in the proper format.
You must use the output statement format based on the example above.
You can define additional functions if needed. 
You must present code that is readable and has comments explaining the logic of your solution. A 10% penalty will be applied to submissions not following this guideline.
You cannot use global variables. A 100% penalty will be applied to submissions using global variables. 
Not using multiple POSIX threads to implement your solution will translate into a penalty of 100%.
A penalty of 100% will be applied to solutions that do not compile.
A penalty of 100% will be applied to solutions hardcoding the output.
